# rectangular

A basic rectangle class with width and height attributes and methods to calculate its area and perimeter.

You may instantiate a Rectangle by providing the desired width and height to the constructor. These two attributes are also publicly available. E.g.:

```
Rectangle myRect = new Rectangle(width, height);
myRect.width = 25;
```

And then there are the area() and perimeter() methods that simply return the respective value lol.
